## T20wc_powerbi_dashboard

I developed a Power BI project to analyze and identify the best players in categories such as openers, middle-order batsmen, all-rounders, and fast bowlers based on defined performance criteria. Using these insights, I curated my Best XI team. The analysis leveraged custom DAX queries to create quick and efficient measures, enabling fast and accurate evaluation of player performance.
